# actix-surrealdb_login_site
This is just my weekend project, that contains lots of security bugs.
## Before you run it
please make sure you have installed surrealDB on your computer
and make sure you have started it with following command
```
surreal start --log trace --user authsite --pass pa55w0rd memory
```
You will have to have the [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com/) installed on your machine to use this application.
